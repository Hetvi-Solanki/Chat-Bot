CHATBOTS - Using Natural Language Processing and Tensorflow

A Chatbot that Understands the Context of Sentense and Respond accordingly. These are the Things that we are going to do in this Project -

Transforming the Conversational Intents into Tensorflow model (Neural Network using TFLEARN) using NLP and Save it as Pickle also.
Load the Same Pickle and Model to Build the Framework to Process the Responses.
At Last, We Show How the Inputs are Processed and Give the Reponses.

It is a subject oriented chatBot, it helps a python beginner to start learning and coding in python.
Here is a demo :
